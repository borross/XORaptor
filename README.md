# XORaptor
Tiny PYTHON programm to XOR with given gamma (key) and binary read strings of files (certain filetypes). <br />
Programm recursively search .pdf and .xlsx files in created XOR foulder in %USERNAME%\Downloads, 
making XOR with given key and secure deleteting files (wrinting random data into file (number of passes is configurable), then delete it) <br />
Mode of encrypting and decryping determined by ENC variable (ENC=0 is decrypting mode). If comething go wrong, files are easily recover by shadow copy feature of MS Windows. <br />
Code is for educational purposes!
